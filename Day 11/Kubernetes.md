# Kubernetes

Kubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s) is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and operation of application containers. It helps manage containers in a clustered environment, providing tools for deploying applications, scaling them as needed, and managing their lifecycle.
